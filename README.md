# XlightsSequenceAdapter

I wrote this little tool when I was very new to xLights and sequencing.  It is an interesting tool and works well especially for older sequences before xLights had a pack feature.

It's also great fun to see how many effects are on various elements in a show and rapidly play with various mappings.
